I'm just going to add my comments here at the top because I don't have
many:

1. It's "Wanderer above the Sea of Fog" by Caspar David Friedrich (the
   painting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanderer_above_the_Sea_of_Fog][hangs in Hamburg]] where I grew up, and I've often admired
   it).

2. Especially the command of Org-mode is impressive!

3. The list of references is insufficient - it only includes image
   references. For example what motivated these questions? For a
   survey, the methodology including questions and embedding of the
   questions in current research and applications is crucial.

Otherwise, this project is on a good path, and I'm curious to see what
comes next. Actually, next up is the literature review, which will be
good for you.

** Brief Research Description

   This project aims to systematically investigate the utilization of 
   Generative AI (GAI) by students within the university context, specifically at
   Lyon College. The primary objectives of this study are to identify the 
   prevalence, extent, and nature of GAI usage among students. The research aims 
   to address the following questions: 
   
   1. What proportion of students at Lyon College engage with Generative AI in 
      their academic activities?

   2. How frequently do students utilize Generative AI in their academic pursuits? 
      (e.g., daily, weekly, occasionally)

   3. For what specific academic purposes do students employ Generative AI? 
      (e.g., completing assignments, enhancing study practices, generating creative content)

   4. Which Generative AI tools are most commonly favored by students?

   5. In which academic disciplines is Generative AI usage most prevalent among students?

** Reasons

  This research is of significant interest because it provides an opportunity to gather raw, 
  real-world data on the use of Generative AI among college students, particularly within the 
  context of education. Given the growing attention and concerns surrounding the use of AI in 
  academic settings, this study addresses a timely and relevant issue. 
  
  Also, our curiosity about how these tools are being integrated into students' academic lives 
  motivates us to pursue this project. 

  Moreover, the potential for a publishable outcome adds value to this research, as it 
  offers the possibility of contributing new insights to the broader academic 
  conversation on AI in education.

** Constraints

   Difficulties in the project may include:

   1. *Creating a comprehensive poll with minimal bias*: Ensuring that the questions are well-designed and unbiased can be challenging, as it requires careful consideration of wording and structure.

   2. *Involving a sufficient number of students in participating in the poll*: Encouraging enough students to complete the poll to gather representative data may be difficult, especially in terms of outreach and engagement.

   3. *Organizing the data collected from the poll into a suitable form for analysis*: Ensuring that the data is clean, well-structured, and ready for analysis.

** Goals and Non-Goals

   *Goals* for this project include finding answers to the questions outlined 
   in the research description:

   1. *Determine the proportion of students at Lyon College who engage with 
      Generative AI in their academic activities.*

   2. *Assess the frequency with which students utilize Generative AI in 
      their academic pursuits.*

   3. *Identify the specific academic purposes for which students employ 
      Generative AI.*

   4. *Determine the Generative AI tools that are most commonly favored by students.*

   5. *Analyze the academic disciplines where Generative AI usage is most prevalent 
      among students.*


   *Non-Goals* include:
   
   1. *Asses the consequences of using AI in an academic context for a student.*

   2. *Evaluating the effectiveness of Generative AI tools in enhancing 
      academic performance.*
   
   3. *Developing or recommending specific policies or guidelines for AI 
      usage in education.*
 
   4. *Evaluating the ethical implications of Generative AI usage in education.*

** Metrics

   The success of the project will be measured using the following criteria:
   
   1. *Survey Participation Rate*: 200+ students participated.
      
   2. *Data Completeness and Quality*: manage to structure the data in 
      a proper way for analysis.

   3. *Alignment with Research Questions*: Answer all the research questions in
      a clear and concise manner.

   4. *Publication*
