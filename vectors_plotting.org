* VECTORS PLOTTING PRACTICE

This is a short 30-45 minute exercise to review plotting vectors in
various formats - as histogram, barplot, line plot, or scatter plot.

1. Load the dataset =uspop= into your current R session, and list all
   user-defined objects of this session (the output should be
   "uspop").
   #+begin_src R
     rm(list = ls())
     data("uspop")
     ls()

   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : [1] "uspop"

2. Check the structure of the =uspop= dataset.
   #+begin_src R
     str(uspop)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   :  Time-Series [1:19] from 1790 to 1970: 3.93 5.31 7.24 9.64 12.9 17.1 23.2 31.4 39.8 50.2 ...

3. Print the values of the =uspop= dataset.
   #+begin_src R
   print(uspop)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Time Series:
   : Start = 1790 
   : End = 1970 
   : Frequency = 0.1 
   :  [1]   3.93   5.31   7.24   9.64  12.90  17.10  23.20  31.40  39.80  50.20  62.90  76.00  92.00 105.70
   : [15] 122.80 131.70 151.30 179.30 203.20

4. Look up the help for =uspop= - you need to switch to the R console to
   do this. Copy the description into this ~example~ block:
   #+begin_quote
   This data set gives the population of the United States (in
   millions) as recorded by the decennial census for the period
   1790-1970.
   #+end_quote

5. =uspop= is a time series just like =Nile= from class. Create a
   line plot for =uspop=. Make sure you can open/close it with
   <F6>/<F7>.
   #+begin_src R :file uspop.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
   plot(uspop, type="line")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:uspop.png]]

6. Replace the x- and y-axis labels and add a title: use "Year", and
   for the y-axis, use "Population [millions]". For the title, use
   "U.S. population 1790-1970 Decennical Census Data"
   #+begin_src R :file uspop2.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
   plot(uspop, type="line", 
        main ="U.S. population 1790-1970 Decennical Census Data", 
        xlab = "Year",
        ylab = "Population [millions]")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:uspop2.png]]

7. Return to the help file. It should still be open in one of your
   Emacs buffers: =*help[R](uspop)*=. Scroll to the end of the document
   (=M-SHIFT->=) and copy the =plot= command in the "Examples" section
   into the code block below, then run it.
   #+begin_src R :file uspop3.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
     plot(uspop, log = "y", main = "uspop data", xlab = "Year",
          ylab = "U.S. Population (millions)")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:uspop3.png]]

8. Can you explain the difference between these two plots? Write your
   answer in the box below:
   #+begin_quote
   The first plot uses the population in millions as the y-axis without any transformation. 
   In contrast, the plot from the help documentation example applies the natural logarithm 
   to the y-axis (population in millions), causing the curve to appear steeper as a result.
   #+end_quote

9. What would a histogram of this dataset look like? Create one (it's
   not very interesting because it doesn't show change over
   time). Change the title to "Histogram of U.S. population
   1790-1970", and the x-axis label to "Population [millions]".
   #+begin_src R :file uspopHist.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
   hist(uspop, 
        main="Histogram of U.S. population 1790-1970", 
        xlab= "Population [millions]")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:uspopHist.png]]

10. Load the =women= dataset and display its structure:
    #+begin_src R :session *R* :results output :exports both
    data("women")
    str(women)
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    : 'data.frame':	15 obs. of  2 variables:
    :  $ height: num  58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 ...
    :  $ weight: num  115 117 120 123 126 129 132 135 139 142 ...

11. Create a scatterplot of the womens' =weight= as a function of
    =height=. Title the plot "Womens' height vs. weight", and rename the
    x- and y-axis labels to "Height (in)" and "Weight [lbs]",
    respectively.
    #+begin_src R :file women.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
    plot(x=women$height, 
         y=women$weight,
         main="Womens' height vs. weight",
         xlab="Height (in)",
         ylab="Weight [lbs]")
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    [[file:women.png]]

12. Load the =ChickWeight= dataset. It has a numeric vector =weight= and a
    =factor= named =Diet= for different diets of the chickens.

    Plot the =weight= of the chickens as a function of the =Diet=:
    #+begin_src R :file chickDiet.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
    data("ChickWeight")
    plot(x=ChickWeight$Diet, y=ChickWeight$weight)
    
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    [[file:chickDiet.png]]

13. Create a bar plot of the =factor= variable =Diet= of the =ChickWeight=
    dataset, title it "Chickens by diet type", change the factor level
    labels to "Diet 1", "Diet 2", "Diet 3" and "Diet 4", and add an
    y-axis label "Number of chickens".
    #+begin_src R :file barChick.png :session *R* :results file graphics output :exports both
    barplot(table(ChickWeight$Diet), 
            main="Chickens by diet type",
            names.arg=c("Diet 1", "Diet 2", "Diet 3", "Diet 4"),
            ylab="Number of chickens",
            col="blue",
            border="white")
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS:
    [[file:barChick.png]]
